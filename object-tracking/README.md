# Object Tracking with OpenCV

This is a simple real-time object tracking script using OpenCV’s built-in KCF tracker.

## 📹 What It Does

- Opens your laptop camera.
- Lets you select a Region of Interest (ROI) to track.
- Tracks the selected object in real time using KCF tracker.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- Webcam access

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python basic_tracker.py
Then select the object in the window that pops up.

## 📌 Notes

- Press **'q'** to exit the tracking window.
- This is a basic example — more advanced trackers (like CSRT, MOSSE) can be explored next.
