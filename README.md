# Computer Vision Playground 🚀

This repository is a collection of mini-projects and experiments as I learn computer vision fundamentals. I'm exploring concepts like object detection, depth estimation, and pose tracking using Python, OpenCV, and PyTorch.

## 🔧 Planned Topics

- [ ] Monocular Depth Estimation (MiDaS)
- [ ] Object Tracking with OpenCV
- [ ] Edge Detection & Contours
- [ ] Real-time Camera Input Processing
- [ ] YOLOv8 Object Detection (Beginner Level)
